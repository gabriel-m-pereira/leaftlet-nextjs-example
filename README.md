This repository consists of both a basic and styled implemetation of Leaflet in a NEXT.JS enviroment using App Router.

In the basic version, you'll find the map working in its simplest form, with no clusters, no custom icon for the markers, etc.
In the styled version althought, we have clusters, map skins (from Stadia and Jawg) and custom icon for both markers and clusters. ATTENTION: for the Jawg styles to work, you have to register in their website and get a Token. I've created an import for the token (use exemple provided in the project as reference), but it's import and use is commented out in the Map component.

Feel free to use this as a reference when implementing Leaflet in your project.
